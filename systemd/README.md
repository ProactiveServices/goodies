# systemd files
These are written for Debian-based systems. Directives which are not yet supported by my systems' systemd are included, but left commented-out in case they break things after an upgrade.

Rather than blindly throw in many directives, I have done my best to read and understand documentation and advice on best practices, particularly with security and reliability in mind.
